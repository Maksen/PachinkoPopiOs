</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_8"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.8</h1>
<ul>
<li>A new method has been added to <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> for COPPA compliance - CoppaOptOut and setCoppaOptOut. In the documentation, COPPA compliance is described in <a class="el" href="reference_gamespecific.html#rgs_COPPA">COPPA Compliance</a>.</li>
<li>A new class has been added for push notifications, <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_push_notification_manager.html" title="Enables push notifications. ">bfgPushNotificationManager</a>.

<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_7"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.7</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rn_4_7_purchaseVerificationModes"></a>
Purchase verification modes</h2>
<p>With SDK 4.7, game developers can take advantage of new security measure with IOS 7 receipts. Now game developers can employ one of the following Purchase Verification modes in their game.</p>
<ul>
<li>clientOnly Verification Mode: The verification for purchase is done only on the client side. There will still be a call to the purchase service, but this is just for Business Intelligence reporting. (Intended for IOS 7 and later devices.)</li>
<li>serverOnly Verification Mode: There is no clientSide verification, the receipt is sent to the server for verification, and the server does the verification by calling the Apple service. (Intended for IOS 6 and earlier devices.)</li>
<li>clientAndServer Verification Mode: Both client and server verification is done. (Intended for IOS 7 and later devices.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A single game can have two verification modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>IOS 6 Verification Mode: Verification mode targeted for IOS 6 and earlier devices.</li>
<li>IOS 7 Verification Mode: Verification mode targeted for IOS 7 and later devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the documentation, this is discussed in <a class="el" href="f2p_purchase.html#f2p_purchaseVerificationModes">Purchase Verification Modes for Free-to-Play Games</a> and in <a class="el" href="freemium_purchase.html#freemium_purchaseVerificationModes">Purchase Verification Modes for Freemium Games</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rn_4_7_hbi"></a>
HBI</h2>
<p>As an additional security measure to the Big Fish purchase flow, each game is now assigned a special key named "hbi" to be placed in the bfg_default_settings.json. This key is critical to the proper function of In-App Purchasing.</p>
<p>Game developers may obtain an hbi value from their Big Fish Producer. For more information, also see <a class="el" href="freemium_purchase.html">Making Freemium In-App Purchases</a> and <a class="el" href="f2p_purchase.html">Making Free-to-Play In-App Purchases</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rn_4_7_hasOffers"></a>
HasOffers</h2>
<p>With SDK 4.7, the HasOffers implementation has moved to the client. This means that the client SDK will handle all install and purchase API calls to HasOffers. There is no additional work to you as a developer to implement the HasOffers reporting.</p>
<p>On the Mobile Admin tool, it is still a requirement to set up a HasOffers event for each game implementing HasOffers. Start and end dates will be sent to the client during the startup API call. The client will use these dates to determine whether or not to send install and purchase information to HasOffers.</p>
<p>SDKs 4.2 - 4.6 still rely on the server implementation of HasOffers, which is unchanged.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_6"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.6</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="interfacebfg_app_manager.html" title="Installing and launching other apps. ">bfgAppManager</a> has been created to allow games to link to the Big Fish Games app. Generic methods have also been included to install and launch external apps.</p>
<p>The <b>Tell A Friend</b> functionality is now supported via the <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> class.</p>
<ul>
<li>[<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> canShowTellAFriendButton] should be used to determine if the settings have been downloaded and the button can be displayed.</li>
<li>[<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> showTellAFriend] will bring up the configured email UI.</li>
<li>All reporting of this event is handled by the SDK.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now support placements via PlayHaven. See <a class="el" href="reference_class.html#bfgEventReporting">Game Event Reporting - bfgGameReporting</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration instructions now appear separately for Freemium and Free-to-Play games: <a class="el" href="freemium_purchase.html">Making Freemium In-App Purchases</a> and <a class="el" href="f2p_purchase.html">Making Free-to-Play In-App Purchases</a>.</li>
<li>An <a class="el" href="reference_sdk_feature_configurability.html">SDK Feature Configuration Matrix</a> has been added in the Technical References section.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_5_1"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.5.1</h1>
<p>SDK 4.5.1 addresses an issue where the Login UI could get in a bad state if a view was presented over it. For example, when the user chose to view the "Privacy Policy," the Login UI would report that it had closed even though it was only temporarily covered.</p>
<p>The SDK now uses two notifications associated with the Login UI and fires them appropriately: BFG_NOTIFICATION_LOGIN_OPENED (new in 4.5.1) and BFG_NOTIFICATION_LOGIN_CLOSED.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_5"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.5</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase_object.html" title="Data for a particular In-App Purchase. ">bfgPurchaseObject</a> now contains a canceled field. If your In-App Purchase fails and canceled is set to YES, the purchase was canceled by the user.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="interfacebfg_login_controller.html" title="Manages BigFish Login. ">bfgLoginController</a> has been created to allow users to log in and out of the Big Fish ecosystem. This system is shared across apps.</p>
<p>Server side control of crash analytics via Flurry is now enabled by default.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_4"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.4</h1>
<p>Static iSplash images have been removed from the resource bundle and replaced by localized images that are created dynamically. If the user is using a supported language, localized image content will be downloaded and used in the iSplash button on the Main Menu. UIImage objects can be retrieved for the Main Menu button with [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_splash.html" title="API for iSplash newsletter functionality. ">bfgSplash</a> splashMenuImageNormal] and [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_splash.html" title="API for iSplash newsletter functionality. ">bfgSplash</a> splashMenuImageHighlighted]. Alternatively, a fully functional UIButton that is configured to send the email and hide itself is available via [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_splash.html" title="API for iSplash newsletter functionality. ">bfgSplash</a> createSplashButton].</p>
<p>A mail controller helper class, <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_mail_controller.html" title="Helper class for presenting a mail composer. ">bfgMailController</a>, has been added to easily present a customized email composer to the user. This class can be used to implement "Tell A Friend" functionality.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_3"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.3</h1>
<p>The 4.3 release has some new APIs for enabling Free-to-Play games to take advantage of Big Fish services and external reporting vendors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_2"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.2</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_2_Purchase"></a>
bfgPurchase</h2>
<p>The class that manages In-App Purchases, <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a>, has undergone a major re-write to improve its security and deter fraud. We have also added additional checks to ensure that <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> is properly initialized before purchases can begin.</p>
<p>These changes require the Security.framework to be linked to the project.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of the security improvements, all games that integrate with the Big Fish iOS SDK will now be required to use the <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> class for all In-App Purchases from Apple.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://developer.bigfishgames.com/ios_v4_2_html/reference_purchase.html" class="el" target="_self">Making In-App Purchases with the iOS SDK</a> for all the changes to In-App Purchases.</p>
<p>Purchase related NSNotifications have changed and must be reviewed.</p>
<p>Purchase methods have been re-written and have slightly different functionality and names.</p>
<p>Removed but replaced with similar methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> beginPurchase]</li>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> completePurchase]</li>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> restorePurchase]</li>
</ul>
<p>Completely removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> isPurchased] The game is now responsible for securely storing all purchases. <b>THE BIG FISH iOS SDK WILL CACHE PRODUCT INFO DURING RUNTIME, BUT WILL NO LONGER STORE THE USER'S PURCHASE HISTORY.</b></li>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> reportPurchaseCompletedSuccessfully] &ndash; Logging is handled by the purchase class without explicit calls.</li>
<li>Removed [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> cancelPurchase] &ndash; Purchasing is no longer a two-phase process, so there is no notion of programmatically canceling.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_2_Miscellaneous"></a>
Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><b>Upgraded minimum supported iOS version to 5.0.*</b></p>
<p>The Big Fish iOS SDK is only distributed as a framework. Source code for the Big Fish iOS SDK will no longer be distributed with the Big Fish iOS SDK. If you require the source for your project, please contact your producer with your request.</p>
<p>Added [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> checkForInternetConnectionAndAlert:(BOOL)alert] to check for an internet connection and optionally display a UIAlert if there is no internet connection.</p>
<p>Removed bfgRatingConsts.h and streamlined other header files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_1_1"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.1.1</h1>
<p>This release allows games to adhere to Apple's new submission requirements as of May 1, 2013. There are also a couple of minor fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed [[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier] completely from the source.</li>
<li>Added iPhone 5 screen support.</li>
<li>Added rating URLs to default settings.</li>
<li>Added maximum size limitation to session events.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_1"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.1</h1>
<p>We did a lot of refactoring to take advantage of new XCode and Objective-C features. For upgrade information, see <a class="el" href="_u_p_g_r_a_d_e41.html">4.1 Upgrade Steps</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded minimum XCode version to 4.5</li>
<li>Upgraded minimum iOS version to 4.3</li>
<li>Added more pricing and details to product information stored by the <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> class. The key for price as a string has been changed from "price" to "priceString". The price as an NSDecimalNumber is now accessible under the key "price". <b>Note:</b> This will need to be changed in your code when you upgrade to 4.1.</li>
<li>Removed all sharedInstance calls and moved to static calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to provide a clean and simple interface when working with the BFG iOS SDK, some ways of accessing BFG methods have changed. Most common change pattern: [[someClass sharedInstance] someMethod] becomes [someClass someMethod] See <a class="el" href="_a_p_i_changes41.html">4.1 API Changes</a> for a complete list of changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Big Fish iOS SDK now uses automatic reference counting (ARC).</b> ARC automatically injects the retain and release calls that Objective-C developers formerly had to manage themselves. This compile-time optimization reduces the chance of accidentally leaking an object and is Apple's recommended system for development. Your code does not need to use ARC.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="el" href="interfacebfg_rating.html" title="Enables users to rate games. ">bfgRating</a> Improvements</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed bfgRating.bfgstring and added new values into bfg_default_settings.json. <b>Note:</b> The keys have changed for the Ratings settings.</li>
</ul>

<li>And don't forget about the great API [<a class="el" href="interfacebfg_rating.html" title="Enables users to rate games. ">bfgRating</a> mainMenuRateApp] to navigate directly to the AppStore's rating page. This should be called when users clicks on "Rate App" from Main Menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Added server side Has Offers support.</b></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_4_0"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 4.0</h1>
<p>The 4.0 release has new APIs for enabling Free-to-Play games to take advantage of our services.</p>
<p>See the new <a class="el" href="_f2_p.html">Free-to-Play Games Overview</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>It also has brought back the ability to use your game specific iPad background images if the default.png does not look acceptable in the iPad Start Game GDN. For most games this is not necessary, but the option is there for games whose default image does not look good as a background for the GDN.</p>
<p>bfgBranding's view controller now forwards orientation change request to its parent view controller. So branding should support your game's orientation by default.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_3_1"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 3.1</h1>
<p>The 3.1 release has the new Big Fish branding resources.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="New_Features_3_0"></a>
New features of Big Fish iOS SDK 3.0</h1>
<p>The main feature with the 3.0 release is better update time of specials, icons and ads. Most of these improvements will have no impact on the implementation details for games.</p>
<p>Some supporting classes and file names have changed. You will need to delete the old iOS SDK framework from your project and re-add the new iOS SDK framework to get the complete update.</p>
<p><b>Simplified Ads</b></p>
<p>You can now use the <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_manager.html" title="Initialize the Big Fish Game Components. ">bfgManager</a> class to start and stop ads easily. It assumes that the parentViewController is to be used as the parent view controller for the ads. </p>
