 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_MainMenu"></a>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_ratingPrompts"></a>
In-Game Rating Prompts</h1>
<p>If required. Contact your Big Fish Producer.</p>
 &#x25a2;  Updated <b>bfg_default_settings.json</b> in <b>bfg_gamespecific_resources</b> with ratings settings. </p>
 &#x25a2;  When the user taps "Remind me later", rating prompts appear after an additional 1/4 of game play has elapsed. </p>
 &#x25a2;  When the user taps "Rate GAME TITLE now", the player is taken to the App Store page to rate the game, and rating prompts no longer appear.  <br/>

 &#x25a2;  In-App Purchase tested successfully by using “dummy app”; see <a class="el" href="iap_dummy_app_test.html">Testing In-App Purchases</a> for instructions.</p>
 &#x25a2;  After In-App Purchase tested, Xcode project reverted to all IDs provided by Big Fish Producer. </p>
 &#x25a2;  In-App Purchase guidelines followed and new purchases saved and then "finished"; see <a class="el" href="f2p_purchase.html">Making Free-to-Play In-App Purchases</a>. <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_reporting"></a>
Reporting</h1>
 &#x25a2;  Game is reporting all required events defined by <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_game_reporting.html" title="Required game logging APIs. ">bfgGameReporting</a> class. </p>
 &#x25a2;  DEBUG enabled to check for correct calls from <a class="el" href="interfacebfg_purchase.html" title="Manages Apple&#39;s In-App Purchases. ">bfgPurchase</a> class; see <a class="el" href="_d_e_b_u_g.html">Debugging with the SDK</a>. <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_loading"></a>
Loading</h1>
 &#x25a2;  If load time is longer than 1 second, animation or loading message (unique to the game) appears to indicate that the device has not locked up. (Developer branding on the "Loading" screen will be rejected.) </p>
 &#x25a2;  Integrity of save data checked every time the game loads. </p>
 &#x25a2;  If primary data is corrupt, data from a secondary save slot is automatically loaded. </p>

 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_saving"></a>

 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_audio"></a>

 &#x25a2;  Turning off the ringer or using the mute button turns off all game audio. </p>
 &#x25a2;  Audio played by multi-tasking apps (e.g., iPod or Pandora) takes precedence, and game music does not play over outside audio.  <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_marketing"></a>

 &#x25a2;  Installs on all targeted devices. If any devices are excluded (for example, 3G devices or iPad 1), the game does not install. </p>
 &#x25a2;  Bundle IDs, Bundle Name, Bundle Display Name, and Project Name all follow Big Fish guidelines. </p>
 &#x25a2;  Initial source committed to EXTSVN repository at Pre-Alpha once the Xcode requirements are met. Big Fish Producer confirmed successful set up in automation system.  <br/>

 &#x25a2;  All text that refers to "mouse," "cursor," or any other PC/Mac specific feature removed or replaced and added to the .txt document for localization. </p>
 &#x25a2;  If available in game, Strategy Guide checked to match iOS content, modified strings added to the .txt document for localization. </p>
 &#x25a2;  Approved marketing text and bullet points for iOS game added to the .txt document for localization. </p>

</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2pCh_betaReadinessChecks"></a>

 &#x25a2;  All Loc strings delivered to Big Fish Producer in an editable format (.xml or .txt preferred). </p>
 &#x25a2;  No local copies of the Big Fish iOS SDK included with game source. <b>Note:</b> This does not include <b>bfg_gamespecific_resources</b> that need to be included locally. </p>
 &#x25a2;  Flurry events, session events (Big Fish server), revenue events (Big Fish server), and Product ID (Big Fish server) all tracking. Use DEBUG to check calls are being made correctly; see <a class="el" href="_d_e_b_u_g.html">Debugging with the SDK</a>.</p>
 &#x25a2;  In-App Purchase tested successfully by using “dummy app”; see <a class="el" href="iap_dummy_app_test.html">Testing In-App Purchases</a> for instructions. </p>
