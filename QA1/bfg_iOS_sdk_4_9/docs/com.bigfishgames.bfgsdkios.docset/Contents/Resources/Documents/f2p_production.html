<p>Big Fish builds, tests, and distributes games created by third-party developers. To facilitate game production, Big Fish requires developers to follow these production standards.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>For further information on Apple submission requirements, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/App-RelatedResources/App-RelatedResources.html" class="el" target="_blank">App-Related Resources</a> in Apple's <em>iOS App Programming Guide</em>.</dd></dl>

Build Requirements</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Game_submission"></a>
Submitting a game build</h2>
<p>Complete the following steps to submit a game build to Big Fish:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Build games with Xcode 4.5 or later. Notify Big Fish of the version of Xcode used.</li>
<li>Configure the project according to the <a class="el" href="production.html#Xcode_requirements">Xcode requirements</a> described in the following sections of this document.</li>
<li>Test the build in a clean environment prior to submission.</li>
<li>Ensure that the game builds and runs on all targeted devices.</li>
<li>For all builds after the Beta, update the <a class="el" href="production.html#JIRA">JIRA</a> database and note all bug fixes in the comments.<ul>
<li>Resolve and reassign bugs back to the original "Reporter" for regression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit the build to the trunk of your <a class="el" href="production.html#SVN">External Subversion (SVN) repository</a> on <a href="https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com" class="el" target="_blank">https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com</a>.</li>
<li>Provide full <a class="el" href="production.html#Build_notes">Build notes</a> by e-mail to the <b>mobile-builds@bigfishgames.com</b> alias.</li>
</ol>
 
   <div style=color:red><blockquote><b>Important:</b> Big Fish will reject builds that do not fulfill all of the above requirements. Rejected builds are <b>not</b> eligible for milestone payments.</blockquote></div>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_server_selection"></a>
Server selection</h2>
<p>As part of the Big Fish build process, Big Fish QA requires the ability to select which server a game is using. Developers <em>must</em> build hooks into their game to check for the following preprocessor macros that point to the environments Big Fish has set up for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>PROD_SERVER</li>
<li>STAGE_SERVER</li>
<li>QA_SERVER</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Xcode_requirements"></a>
Xcode requirements</h2>
<p>Use the following standards for your Xcode project:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Project name:</b> Use the full name of the game. If the game name is too long, contact your Big Fish Producer to agree on a shorter name. <br/>
 <br/>
</li>
<li><b>Targets:</b> Use the targets option to contain multiple game SKUs in a single project. iPhone and iPad should be different targets within the same project. For more information about creating targets in Xcode, see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#recipes/xcode_help-scheme_editor/Articles/SchemeBuild.html" class="el" target="_blank">Scheme Editing Help - Building Multiple Targets</a>. <br/>
 <br/>
</li>
<li><b>Target names:</b> To promote consistency, use the following naming conventions for your targets.<ul>
<li><b>Free-to-Play iPad games:</b> Name of the game</li>
<li><b>Free-to-Play iPhone/iPod games:</b> Name of the game <br/>
 <br/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Provisioning:</b> Before you commit a build to <b>trunk</b> in SVN, set the provision to “default“ for all targets (instructions below), rather than using the provisioning profile for your company. This enables Big Fish to build projects by using our own provisioning profile. <br/>
 <br/>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Set the default wildcard option:</b> The <b>iPhone Developer</b> profile is the wildcard.</p>
<p class="startli">Selecting this profile automatically populates the <b>Code Signing Identity</b> field with the code signing identity of the local machine. This enables both developers and Big Fish to populate the field with their local code signing identity without having to change this field manually every time.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open your project in Xcode.</li>
<li>Click <b>Build Settings</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Code Signing</b> section, click <b>Code Signing Identity</b>.</li>
<li>Under the <b>Automatic Profile Selector (Recommended)</b> section, select <b>iPhone Developer</b>. <br/>
 <br/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Define a custom URL scheme:</b> In Xcode, add the following key to info.plist files for all targets:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;array&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    &lt;dict&gt;</div>
<div class="line">        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;</div>
<div class="line">        &lt;<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;Bundle_ID&lt;/<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;</div>
<div class="line">        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;</div>
<div class="line">        &lt;array&gt;</div>
<div class="line">            &lt;<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;Bundle_ID&lt;/<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;</div>
<div class="line">        &lt;/array&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    &lt;/dict&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/array&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> <i style=color:red>Bundle_ID</i>  is the bundle identifier for your game, for example <b>com.bigfishgames.testapp</b>. The custom URL scheme enables Big Fish to launch apps from within other apps, Web pages, or e-mail messages.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ARM 7 optimized architecture:</b> Set the architectures setting in Xcode to <b>ARM-7 Optimized</b> and add the following to your iPhone infop.plist file:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;key&gt;UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities&lt;/key&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;array&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;armv7&lt;/<span class="keywordtype">string</span>&gt;</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/array&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Bundle_ID_IAP_ID"></a>
Bundle IDs and In-App Purchase IDs</h2>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Your Big Fish Producer will provide the necessary Bundle IDs and In-App Purchase IDs for all of your game SKUs.</dd></dl>
<p>Standard format:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">com.bigfishgames.[gamename][store][device][type] </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Where <em>[store]</em> is replaced with the publicly traded stock codes for the platform (for example, iOS games use “aapl”), <em>[device]</em> is <b>tablet</b> or <b>phone</b>, and the <em>[type]</em> is <b>free</b> or <b>f2p</b>.</p>
<p>Each Bundle identifier includes a unique <b>PRODUCT_NAME:identifier</b>, which is also known as the "Bundle ID Suffix."</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">com.bigfishgames.PRODUCT_NAME:identifier </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Big Fish uses the <b>PRODUCT_NAME:identifier</b> for tracking and marketing purposes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Application_bundles"></a>
Application bundles</h2>
<p>Application bundles contain a package of project resource files for your game in a hierarchical directory with the .app extension. The Xcode project for your game will create an application bundle for each target. It is required that the <b>PRODUCT_NAME:identifier</b> (or Bundle ID Suffix) is used for the application bundle name for each target to help differentiate between SKUs.</p>
<p>For example, if the Bundle ID Suffix strings for Game X are:</p>
<ul>
<li>gamexaaplphonefree</li>
<li>gamexaapltabletfree</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the .app files for Game X would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>gamexaaplphonefree.app</li>
<li>gamexaapltabletfree.app</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is also required that the Bundle ID Suffix is used as the Product name and Bundle name in the .plist files for each SKU.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_JIRA"></a>
JIRA</h2>
<p>You <em>must</em> update Big Fish's web-based bug tracking dataset <a href=" http://extmon.bigfishgames.com:8080/secure/Dashboard.jspa" class="el" target="_blank">JIRA</a> before you submit each new build. If you did not receive an e-mail message containing account credentials and the location of your JIRA project, contact your Big Fish Producer.</p>
<p><b>For each resolved bug:</b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a comment including the build version that contains the fix.</li>
<li>Assign the bug to the "Reporter" who originally reported the bug so that person can track the fix for regression.</li>
<li>Resolve the bug with the appropriate disposition, usually "Fixed."</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_SVN"></a>
External Subversion (SVN) repository</h2>
<p>Big Fish provides Subversion (SVN) on an external server for use by third-party developers for each iOS/Android game. Each repository is externally linked to the latest version of the Big Fish iOS SDK, including documentation, and contains a <b>trunk</b> directory and a folder for assets required for marketing materials to be committed by the developer.</p>
<p><b>Follow these requirements while checking in to SVN:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the SVN repository provided by your Big Fish Producer on <a href="https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com" class="el" target="_blank">https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com</a>. If you did not receive an e-mail message containing account credentials and the location of your repository, contact your Big Fish Producer.</li>
<li>Commit the full source code and the project file in the <b>trunk</b> directory for your project.<ul>
<li><b>Example:</b> if your repository is <a href="https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com/svn/game_project/" class="el" target="_blank">https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com/svn/<em>game_project</em>/</a>, submit your builds to <a href="https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com/svn/game_project/trunk" class="el" target="_blank">https://extsvn.bigfishgames.com/svn/<em>game_project</em>/trunk</a>.</li>
<li>If possible, place the project file (.xcodeproj) at the top level, and not within a sub-folder.</li>
<li>Properly submitted code in the trunk folder looks similar to this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=1 style="margin-left:84px;">
  <tr>
    <td>
                /trunk/<i style=color:red>asset or file folder1</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>asset or file folder2</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>asset or file folder3</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>file1</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>file2</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>file3</i><br>
    /trunk/<i style=color:red>XCode  project file</i>
                </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<ul>
<li>After the first commit to SVN, for all new builds only the changes since the last commit are needed. Do not commit the full source every time. Developers should regularly commit their most recent code changes and revisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Fish uses an internal build system to pull code from the repository <b>trunk</b>, and creates each build internally by using its own provisioning profiles. For more information about tools and processes for building games, see <a class="el" href="standards.html">Required Tools and Standards</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Build_notes"></a>
Build notes</h2>
<p>After each new build has been committed to SVN, build notes are required describing all changes from the previous version and should be sent via e-mail in the following format: </p>
<pre class="fragment">            To: mobile-builds@bigfishgames.com

            CC: Producer

            Subject:
            [NOTE: If the build is Pre-Beta, this needs to be mentioned at the beginning of the subject line.]
            [Platform: iOS/F2P/Amazon/Google][Full Game Title] [Trunk Revision]

            Body:
            Hello,

            Build notes:
            [All changes made since last build version. Text only for formatting reasons, no images or screenshots.]

            [Any other special information.]
</pre><p>This e-mail message alerts the Build Management Team, Producer, and QA Team leads at Big Fish to the submission.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SVN repository location is required with all build notes.</li>
<li>The name of your Big Fish Mobile Producer is required with all build notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Versioning"></a>
Versioning</h2>
<p>All game builds <em>must</em> include a version number. Use the following standards for your version numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Format the version number as three numbers separated by a period ( <i style=color:red>X.X.X</i>  ). <ul>
<li>The first number indicates a major release.</li>
<li>The second number indicates minor updates to an existing release.</li>
<li>The final number indicates a revision, typically an interim build that is not released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Pre-Beta builds, increment the final portion of the version number starting from 0.0.1.</li>
<li>Number the first Beta build as 0.1.0. For each build during Beta, increment the second integer. All Beta builds use a 0. <i style=color:red>x</i>.0 format.</li>
<li> <i style=color:red>When the game reaches the Release candidate build, update the version number to 1.0.0 for submission to Apple.</i> </li>
<li>For updates, the third integer will be incremented up to 9, and then the second integer, and so on. It should be difficult to ever reach 2.0.0 for any game title.</li>
<li>The version number should be the same everywhere in the game and in the info.plist file.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="f2p_Localization"></a>
Localization</h1>
<p>Big Fish cannot commit to localizing every iOS game into all supported languages. To achieve the benefits of localization with minimal costs, Big Fish will localize only games that have already been localized or approved for localization for the PC or Mac OS, with the exception of Russian and very occasionally other languages not yet supported for PC. All supported languages should be confirmed with your Big Fish Producer during the specification process.</p>
<p>Localization files are submitted each Thursday for processing the following week. Try to submit earlier in the week to ensure that your location files will be included in the next week's batch.</p>
<p>The following recommendations and requirements help simplify localization and control costs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Submit all text strings in .txt format. </li>
<li>
Begin all lines with a semicolon followed by a String ID for reference. Most developers will just number their String IDs sequentially, for example, GameName_1, GameName_2, and so on. </li>
<li>
After the String ID, include a tabbed space. Do <em>not</em> use a regular space. </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">After the tabbed space include the game text for translation contained inside quotations. Here is what the final strings should look like:</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><code>;GameName_1 "Pause"<br/>
 ;GameName_2 "Restart"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Start with the localization file that Big Fish Games used for the Mac/PC game and include only the differences that have not yet been translated. Common differences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text that refers to "click" or "clicking" <em>must</em> be replaced with text that refers to "tapping," and any references to a mouse or cursor, or any other interface element not used by mobile devices, <em>must</em> be removed.</li>
<li>Text related to menus and other UI elements in iOS that differ from those on a PC or Mac.</li>
<li>Text changes necessitated by the integration of the Game Discovery Network and other Big Fish Games features.</li>
<li>Text changes necessitated by the integration of common iOS features and menus such as Game Center, Achievements, or In-App Purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Submit files in English only. Do not submit files that contain multiple languages, or scripts that add language folders. </li>
<li>
Allow 1 to 2 weeks from when you submit the text strings in English to your Big Fish Producer for your localization files to be returned. You will receive a set of translated files, one for each language. Merge the changes into the original PC or Mac OS files to make a completed iOS localization package. </li>
<li>
After your Producer returns your loction files, create in the Xcode project for your game a language-specific project subdirectory for every language that your game supports. Name these subdirectories in the format language.lproj where "language" is replaced with the standard two-letter code for each language (EN, ES, FR, DE, JP, IT, NL, RU). </li>
<li>
If you discover that you have forgotten to submit a text string for localization, or if you make changes that require additional localized strings, you can submit additional requests to your Big Fish Producer. If a game is already in QA, then all localization requests will be handled by the assigned localization QA Test Lead. </li>
<li>
Your game should automatically detect the language settings for the device and display the text that matches those settings. </li>
<li>
All text <em>must</em> be localized by the time you submit your Beta build. </li>
</ol>
 
   <div style=color:red><blockquote><b>Important:</b> Any Beta build without localizations, except for games that are English-only, will be rejected.</blockquote></div> 
<h1><a class="anchor" id="artRequirements"></a>
Art Requirements</h1>
<p>To help you maximize your game’s profile and revenue potential by optimizing merchandizing on the Big Fish website and in Appstores, Big Fish requires the following art assets. <em>All should be considered mandatory</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsImages"></a>
Images</h2>
<p>Any background images, landscapes, and scenes from your game without any UI. The higher the resolution, the better! The minimum resolution should be 1024x768, but the maximum available resolution is strongly preferred.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsLogos"></a>
Logos</h2>
<p>All game logos, in all forms, on transparent backgrounds. If you use your logo in multiple orientations, include all of them. Please provide these in all languages your game will be released in. Please provide your logos in layered PSD (strongly preferred) or PNG formats.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsCharacters"></a>
Game characters</h2>
<p>All the characters in your game on transparent backgrounds. Include all variations and each in multiple poses – not just static. Include full lengths, 1/3, and close-ups, in the <em>maximum</em> available resolution. The higher the resolution, the better!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsElements"></a>
Specific game elements</h2>
<p>These are discrete elements of game play on transparent backgrounds. Examples include objects from hidden object scenes, pieces from a puzzle, and blocks/gems from match 3 games.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsLoading"></a>
Loading screens</h2>
<p>Any and all loading screens used throughout your game. The higher the resolution the better! The minimum resolution should be 1024x768, but the maximum available resolution is strongly preferred.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsAnimation"></a>
Sprites and animated graphics</h2>
<p>These are images that make up the animations of your game in a layered PSD or in a collection of PNGs.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsUIfonts"></a>
UI and fonts</h2>
<p>All aspects of the UI and any fonts you use within your game (including logo subtitles). These work great for carrying the theme of your game into Big Fish assets.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsScreenshots"></a>
Screenshots</h2>
<p>Big Fish requires 4 or 5 screenshots of different parts of your game that you would like to feature (no duplicate locations or similar views, please). Hidden object adventure games need to have <em>at least</em> 1 hidden object scene, 1 puzzle scene, and 1 adventure scene. These should be as exciting as possible, and should show off different and unique aspects of the game. If there is any text - for example, object lists for hidden object scenes – Big Fish will need additional localized screens for all languages supported.</p>
<p>All screenshots - in all languages - should be provided in the following sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad (2048x1536)</li>
<li>iPhone (960x640 AND 1136x640)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsMisc"></a>
Miscellaneous art files</h2>
<p>Supply anything else you think will help Big Fish make the best assets possible!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="freemiumAssetsGameDescription"></a>
Game description text and marketing bullet points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Detailed description of the game’s story, style, genre, mechanic (1-2 paragraphs)</li>
<li>Specific number of hidden object scenes</li>
<li>Specific number of mini-games/puzzles</li>
<li>Specific number of chapters/adventure scenes</li>
<li>Any unique game play elements</li>
