<h1><a class="anchor" id="qa_phases"></a>
Mobile App Testing</h1>
<p>Big Fish uses a three-phase model for testing mobile apps before release. Each phase is discussed in greater detail in the next section.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Phase 1 </th><th>Phase 2 </th><th>Phase 3  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>General Test Pass </td><td>Screen Shot Pass </td><td>Final Test Pass </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Device Check </td><td>Achievement Pass </td><td>Playthrough (with no skip) </td></tr>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_beta"></a>
Beta Check</h2>
<p>This is the process of preparing your game for QA. It is mostly handled by your Big Fish Producer and Project Coordinator. Here are the key areas that greatly impact QA and might prevent your game from being approved for Beta.</p>
<ul>
<li>The game <em>must</em> have a working build that installs and can be played all the way through.</li>
<li>The game <em>must</em> have sandbox In-App Purchases working.</li>
<li>The Strategy Guide with the Big Fish Games app feature is working.</li>
<li>The game <em>must</em> be externally linked to the latest BFG Lib and not have any local Lib folders or modifications.</li>
<li>Flurry and Session Events are reporting correctly, and PlayHaven placements are appearing.</li>
<li>All supported languages are implemented, using the lastest PC Lockits and mobile diff strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_generalPass"></a>
General Test Pass</h2>
<p>This is the Big Fish QA main test pass and covers all aspects of the game, from Game Discovery Network (GDN) integration to UI elements and general functionality. Most GDN and engine-related bugs will be found during this pass. Mid Pass is a scaled down version of the General Test Pass.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_deviceCheck"></a>
Device Check</h2>
<p>The game will be launched with 5 to 6 other apps running in the background. It will be launched on a wide variety of hardware devices and iOS combinations. It is a launch test, with minor functional and In-App Purchase testing. This test is also performed in Phase 3 for final verification for unsupported devices.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_playthrough"></a>
Playthrough (with no skip)</h2>
<p>A playthrough of the entire game content will be performed from start to finish. The no skip playthrough consists of going through the entire game without skipping any puzzles or anything else that has a skip option given. This will ensure that everything is solvable before the game is released to the public.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_achievement"></a>
Achievement Pass</h2>
<p>If applicable, QA will verify that all achievements can be achieved and unlock correctly. This is usually done in conjunction with a playthrough. Game Center related achievements and leaderboards are verified as unlocking during this pass as well, if applicable.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_strategy"></a>
Strategy Guide Pass</h2>
<p>If the game has a strategy guide, a pass will be performed that includes following the strategy guide exactly for the entirety of the game. Common bugs found in this pass are computer terms being used, such as “click” instead of “tap,” sections of the game removed, or puzzles not matching the correct solution.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_memory"></a>
Memory Test</h2>
<p>If the game is experiencing slowdown, lag, or consistent crashing (due to memory warnings in the console log), Big Fish QA will run a memory test for up to 3 hours with the Instruments tool. QA will use the Memory Monitor to measure Real Memory being used specific to the app itself, with no other outside influences. Typically, games should read no higher than 80 to 90 MB.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_final"></a>
Final Test Pass</h2>
<p>An even more scaled-down version of the General Pass. This will catch common bugs that may have been reintroduced, are game-breaking, and have to be fixed before signoff.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_design"></a>
Design Pass</h2>
<p>The Design Pass will be run to try and improve user experience. It will focus on areas in which the customers have had the most issues (small text, hints, size of hit boxes, etc.). This will be completed in Phase 1.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_updates"></a>
Updates</h2>
<p>Occasionally, there may be a need for an update. The reasons may vary, but could be due to new Apple app requirements, or once the game is live, a change based on customer feedback.</p>
<p>Should an update be needed, the Big Fish Producer of the game will contact the developer regarding the issue and a bug will be logged. Once Big Fish QA receives a new build with the issue fixed, QA will sign off on an update and the submission/approval process will begin for the update. Typically, update version numbers should be set to 1.0.1.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qa_locs"></a>
Mobile Localization QA</h1>
<p>The Big Fish Mobile Localization QA (LQA) team covers four foreign languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>German (DE)</li>
<li>French (FR)</li>
<li>Japanese (JP)</li>
<li>Russian (RU)</li>
</ul>
<p>To optimize efficient use of Big Fish resources and maintain a consistent output, Mobile LQA testing goes through a pre-defined process that is made up of three Phases.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Phase 1 </th><th>Phase 2 </th><th>Phase 3  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>First full game play through completed in Lead Editor’s language. </td><td>Full game play through completed for each remaining language. </td><td>All remaining bugs are regressed. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bugs are entered in JIRA for 1st language. </td><td>Bugs are entered in JIRA for remaining languages. </td><td>... </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Global bugs are entered in JIRA. </td><td>Fixed bugs are regressed. </td><td>... </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Text files are verified to be the latest from PC. </td><td>... </td><td>... </td></tr>
</table>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_mlqa_phases"></a>
Mobile LQA phases</h2>
<p>Mobile LQA can start testing as soon as there is a functionally stable build, i.e., a build without blockers. A Lead Editor is assigned who will own the project from start to end (sign off).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="qa_mlqa_phase_1"></a>
Phase 1</h3>
<p>The Lead Editor starts Phase 1, which means they will start a playthrough of the entire game in search of global bugs as well as their language specific bugs. For example, a Russian Editor leads a project and looks for global as well as Russian specific issues.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to the front-end and buy wall areas of the game where the use of Generic Locs and the latest PC text files are verified.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="qa_mlqa_phase_2"></a>
Phase 2</h3>
<p>Once the Lead has vetted the entire game for their language as well as any global issues, the game is handed off to the remaining languages. This marks the start of Phase 2.</p>
<p>In Phase 2 all remaining Language Editors will play through the game in their respective languages. At the end of Phase 2, the updated text files and any new bugs are entered in JIRA.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="qa_mlqa_phase_3"></a>
Phase 3</h3>
<p>As soon as the last language editors wrap up their test, Phase 3 commences. Phase 3 is mainly an indicator that the game is in the regressions stage. No new bugs are entered unless new issues are introduced.</p>
<p>The Lead is the main person in charge of regressions and any other issues, such as the unsupported language check, collecting marketing materials, etc.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qa_speedUpMLQATesting"></a>
How can developers help speed up Mobile LQA testing?</h2>
<p>Developers can optimize Mobile LQA testing by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ensure use of the latest PC text files. The latest PC Lockits are delivered by the Big Fish PC Producer at the end of Mobile Loc QA testing for PC.</li>
<li>Ensure use of Generic Locs document for common mobile translations. The latest Generic Locs document can be found on the Big Fish External Document FTP site. Contact your Big Fish Producer for access.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any suggestions or comments for the Mobile LQA team, contact your Big Fish Mobile Producer and they will make sure any feedback is speedily delivered. </p>
